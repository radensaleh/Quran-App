## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([domains](https://github.com/radensaleh/Quran-App/tree/master/domains/quran), [features](https://github.com/radensaleh/Quran-App/tree/master/features), [resources](https://github.com/radensaleh/Quran-App/tree/master/resources/resources), [shared_libraries](https://github.com/radensaleh/Quran-App/tree/master/shared_libraries) modules).

    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain A           # Domains module with a data and domains layer inside it.
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain B
    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ domain etc

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features               # Name of directory

    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature etc
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib                    # Name of module (default from Flutter)
